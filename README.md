All GitHub has done is centralize \[GitHub22\], monopolize \[Dohmke22\] and most recently abuse \[DeVault22\] the niche activity that is distributed use of one specific version control system. Following the mania of this century's first quarter, they have done so by building a sluggish webby mammoth. Since proper usage of a version control system is a niche within a niche, they battened their creation with increasingly *friendlier* (a marketing term to conceal one's conception of incompetence regarding one's customers) features, leaving their once vital core rotting in the dust. What is left is a sheer unrecognisable shadow with a vicious compulsion for no one to notice their ruse.  
Long gone are the primordial ideas of the Web, democratizing and decentralizing information across borders. For most, also gone are Git's defining principles: "--distributed-is-the-new-centralized" \[Git22\].
